# SrDuino
SrDuino is an open-source project that has adapted several games created by other users to work on a simple and inexpensive platform to facilitate the dissemination and development of new games and software.
The SrDuino V0.1 is made using a UNO arduino, a Nokia 5110 5Volts screen, 2 potentiometers and 4 push buttons, but this can evolve according to the need of the new codes.
